solution: Define the class Oystercard within the lib folder.

# Irb plan

Plan for top_up testing

open irb 

create a new class instance of oystercard, card

on the new card call the method top_up in order to envoke the top up value and we would include a value as an argument.

We would hope the balance of the card would increase by that amount. (but it won't)
